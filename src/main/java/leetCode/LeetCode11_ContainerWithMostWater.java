 Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, 
 where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines 
 are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
 Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, 
 such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.
